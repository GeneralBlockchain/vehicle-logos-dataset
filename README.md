## About the Dataset

Annotated, machine learning dataset of Vehicle Logos. There are 34 Vehicle Logos classes and 544 images each containing a single cropped vehicle logo and corresponding instance mask. There are 34 logos each with 16 images and masks.

Cropped Logo images have been extracted from larger images containing cars. The car images are created using our mobile application and photographers. The images, crops and masks have been manually created.

Maximum occlusion or truncation for any class annotation is ~10%.

  - All images were collected through our mobile application that is available both on Android and iOS and as such are property of General Blockchain, Inc.
  
  - All annotations were created by our own fully employed in-house team.
  
  - Each cropped image was checked at least twice during the quality assurance process by different people.
  
  - Dataset is available in CSV format.
